GitHub tutorial recommends that you write a description about the project

The tutorial has requested that I edit this branch by making changes to the readme file.

About Joe Niemand

Software developer with 5 years development experience in C# working mostly with web applications in visual studio 2012-2015 using Tortois svn as a source control engine.

I have since started looking at git and am currently training myself to get familiar with Git and Github.

This is a second edit of the readme, using a different branch as this is a new feature to the master branch.
